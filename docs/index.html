        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Aaron Augustin, and Im a Programmer & a 2D/3D Animator.</p>
        <p>Some of the languages I've coded are Haxe/Haxeflixel, HTML/CSS, Javascript & Lua. I'm not really fluent with ALL of them but I have a decent understanding with Haxe, Javascript, & HTML.</p>
        <p>As for animation, I've made some personal projects that have NEVER seen the light of day. (mostly because of laziness, and lack of motivation) 
            I havent really touched Adobe Animate in a while, nor have I touched my tablet, but I am looking forward on starting again soon!</p>
        <p>I usually post my drawing and animaions on social media BUT I dont do animate as frequently as I used to so dont expect much.</p>

        <h3>Spotify Profile - MOCK UP</h3>
        <p>As a school project, we had to do a mock up of a spotify project with ANY artist we wanted. so i did MF Doom lol
            but due to everyone in my class struggling with the project, I decided to make a template on github so everyone could have a better understanding on how to do it.
            (got in trouble after but WORTH IT!)

        <h3>Friday Night Funkin: Definitive Edition</h3>
        <p>Over a year ago, I started working on a Friday Night Funkin' Engine called Definitive Edition. I showed it to one of my pals when it first came out, and he seemed to like it!
            BUT due to downloading issues on his computer, he couldn't really play it.. So in the niceness in my heart, I decided to add it to web! (You're welcome leo).</p>
        <p><strong>Game last updated: FEB 25th, 2023.</strong></p> <p>Probably wont get updated as frequently as of right now. Busy with school, and I just grow apart with the game in general...</p>
