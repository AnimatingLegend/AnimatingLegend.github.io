        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Aaron Augustin, and Im a Programmer & a 2D/3D Animator. Some of the languages ive coded are Haxe/Haxeflixel, HTML/CSS, Javascript (Node.Js), & Lua. 
            As for animation, I've made some personal projects that have NEVER seen the light of day. (mostly because of laziness, and lack of motivation)

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3>Spotify Profile - MOCK UP</h3>
        <p>As a school project, we had to do a mock up of a spotify project with ANY artist we wanted. so i did MF Doom lol
            but due to everyone in my class struggling with the project, i decided to make a template on github so everyone could have a better understanding on how to do it.
            (got in trouble after but WORTH IT!)

        <!-- Adding this here so the code isnt hard to read [SMALL SPACES] -->
        <h3>Friday Night Funkin: Definitive Edition</h3> <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
        <p>Over a year ago, I started working on a Friday Night Funkin' Engine called Definitive Edition. I showed it to one of my pals when it first came out, and he seemed to like it!
            BUT due to downloading issues on his computer, he couldn't really play it.. So in the niceness in my heart, I decided to add it to web! (You're welcome leo).</p>
        <p><strong>Game last updated: FEB 25th, 2023.</strong></p> <p>Probably wont get updated as frequently as of right now. Busy with school, and I just grow apart with the game in general...</p>
